### Dataset
In this setting, we preprocess the data split by removing the id field that is useless for CTR prediction. In addition, we transform the timestamp field into three fields: hour, weekday, and is_weekend. For all categorical fields, we filter infrequent features by setting the threshold min_category_count=2 (performs well) and replace them with a default <OOV> token. Note that we do not follow the exact preprocessing steps in AutoInt, because the authors neither remove the useless id field nor specially preprocess the timestamp field.

To make a fair comparison, we fix embedding_dim=16 as with AutoInt.
