### Environments
+ Hardware

  ```python
  CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690 v4 @ 2.6GHz
  RAM: 500G+
  ```
+ Software

  ```python

  pandas: 1.0.0
  numpy: 1.18.1
  ```

### Dataset
In this setting, we preprocess the data split by removing the id field that is useless for CTR prediction. In addition, we transform the timestamp field into three fields: hour, weekday, and is_weekend. For all categorical fields, we filter infrequent features by setting the threshold min_category_count=1 and replace them with a default <OOV> token. Note that we found that min_category_count=1 performs the best, which is surprising.

We fix embedding_dim=40 following the existing FGCNN work.
