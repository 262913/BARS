# BARS

BARS is the first open benchmark for recommender systems: https://openbenchmark.github.io

Despite the significant progress made in both research and practice of recommender systems over the past two decades, there is a lack of a widely-recognized benchmark in this field. This not only increases the difficulty in reproducing existing studies, but also incurs inconsistent experimental results among them, which largely limit the practical value and potential impact of research in this field. In this project, we make our initiative efforts towards open benchamrking for recommender systems. The BARS benchmark project allows anyone to easily follow and contribute, and hopefully drive more solid and reproducible research on recommender systems.

The BARS benchmark currently covers the following two tasks. 

+ [BarsCTR: A Benchmark for CTR Prediction](https://openbenchmark.github.io/BarsCTR)
+ [BarsMatch: A Benchmark for Candidate Item Matching](https://openbenchmark.github.io/BarsMatch)

Ongoing projects:

+ BarsRank: A Benchmark for Listwise Re-ranking
+ BarsMTL: A Benchmark for Multi-Task Recommendation
